PROGRAMS on Matrix Using CUDA

Solving all the programs using single block and required no of threads within that block

1. Write a program in CUDA to add two matrices for the following specifications:
  a.Each row of resultatn matrix to be computed by one thread
  b. Each column of resultatnt matrix to be computed by one thread 
  c. Each element of resultant matrix to be computed by one thread

2. Write a program in CUDA to multiply two matrices for the following specifications:
  a. Each row of resultatn matrix to be computed by one thread.
  b. Each column of resultatn matrix to be computed by one thread
  c. Each element of resultant matrix to be computed by one thread.
